<h1>SimVascular Simulation Post-Processing - svPost.</h1>
<p>Here you can find example scripts to run svPost and svPost-flows via the command line.<br>
The scripts can be executed locally, or adapted for use on your own servers.<br>
Additional information on svPost is accessible from <a href="https://simvascular.github.io/index.html">SimVascular's website</a>.</p>

<h2>svPost.sh - Example Script</h2>
<h4>svPost.sh requires your simulation to be complete. Files should be in a restart.x format.<br>
The script WILL require editing for application to your simulation, guidance on how to do so is provided below.</h4>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Line 3:</strong> Points the ``svpost`` variable to the installation on your system.<br>
    For pre-built binary installations on Linux, the path to svpost should be similar to the one provided.</li>
    <li><em>Lines 6-8:</em> Set the **start** and **stop** timesteps to be processed, in addition to the **increments/spacing** between them.<br>
    **NOTE 1 - **The pressure and velocity fields take time to stabilise in your simulation.<br>
    Hence, often only the timesteps corresponding to the final cardiac cycle are processed.<br>
    **NOTE 2 - **To calculate values for TAWSS and OSI, the start timestep should be a **NON_ZERO** value.</li>
    <li>**Lines 11-12:** Set the **indir** and **outdir** variables.<br>
    **indir** corresponds to the directory containing the simulation's results in the format *restart.x*.<br>
    **outdir** corresponds to the directory that you want the processed results to be placed into in the format *.vtu* and *.vtp*.<br>
    These variables may need further adjustment if your files are stored on a server - please ask your instituation's IT service for assistance.</li>
    <li>**Line 16 & 18:** are used to call the svpost command with the settings previously specified.<br>
    **NOTE 1 - **Generating a single file for all timesteps may require a lot of RAM, be sure to check you are not running out when issuing this command.
    **NOTE 2 - **You are able to change the name of **all_results** to whatever you wish. However, if you wish to use svPost-flows in the next step it is advised to keep these identical between *.vtp* and *.vtu* files.</li>
    <li>You can now either: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2177932/how-do-i-execute-a-bash-script-in-terminal">run the script locally</a> or submit it to your server.</li>
</ol>

<h2>svPost-flows.sh - Example Script</h2>
<h4>svPost-flows.sh generates the flow and pressure files creted when running svPost from within SimVascular's GUI.<br>
svPost-flows.sh uses the *.vtu* and *.vtp* produced from svPost. Please run that first if you have not already done so.<br>
Similarly, the script WILL require editing to be applied to your simulation. Guidance is given below.</h4>

<ol>
    <li>**PRE-REQUISIT:** This script requires the *'create-flow-files'* binary to be built or installed as outlined <a href="https://github.com/ktbolt/cardiovascular/tree/master/create-flow-files">here</a>.</li>
    <li>**Line 3:** Points the **generate-flows** variable to the binary identified in the *PRE-REQUISIT* step.</li>
    <li>**Lines 6-8:** Sets the **meshDir**, **resDir**, and **outputDir** variables.<br>
    **meshDir** corresponds to the directory of the mesh surface files (.vtp files) for the simulation.<br>
    **resDir** corresponds  to the directory containing the converted simulation results from the previous svPost step.<br>
    **outputDir** corresponds to the directory you wish the pressure and flow files to be written to.</li>
    <li>**Lines 11-13:** Set the remaining options for the conversion and are set to match your simulation.<br>
    **singleFile** should be set to *yes* if svPost converted the files into a single *.vtp* and *.vtu* file. It should be set to *no* if otherwise.<br>
    **skipWalls** should be set to *yes* if you wish to skip the binary calculating average flows and pressures for the wall surfaces. It should be set to *no* otherwise.<br>
    **units** should be set to the unit system of your simulation *cm* or *mm*</li>
