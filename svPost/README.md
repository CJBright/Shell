SimVascular Post-Processing - svPost
====================================

Here you can find example scripts to run ***svPost*** and ***svPost-flows*** via the command line.</br>
The scripts may be executed locally, or adapted for use on your own servers.</br>
Additional information on svPost is available from [SimVascular's website](https://simvascular.github.io/index.html).

## svPost.sh - [Example Script](https://github.com/CJBright/BASH/blob/master/svPost/svPost.sh)
#### This script requires a completed simulation, with files in the ***restart.x*** format. </br>Modifications *WILL* be needed to use the script for your work, guidance on how to do so is provided below.

- **Line 3:** Associates the variable ``svpost`` with the path to the svPost installation on your system.
    - ***NOTE -*** For pre-built binary installations on Linux, the path to svpost should be similar to the one provided.
- **Lines 6-8:** Tell svPost the timestep range to be processed in addition to the spacing between them.
    - ``start`` is the first timestep to be read.
    - ``stop`` is the last timestep to be read.
    - ``incr`` is the spacing which the solver reads them.
        - ***NOTE 1 -*** The pressure and velocity fields take time to stabilise in your simulation.</br>
        Hence, often only the timesteps corresponding to the final cardiac cycle are processed.
        - ***NOTE 2 -*** To calculate values for TAWSS and OSI, the start timestep should be a **NON_ZERO** value.
        - ***NOTE 3 -*** ``incr`` does not have to have the same value as ``timesteps between restarts`` set during the simulation!
- **Lines 11-12:** Set the ``indir`` and ``outdir`` variables.
    - ``indir`` corresponds to the directory containing the simulation's results in the format ***restart.x***.
    - ``outdir`` corresponds to the directory that you want the processed results to be placed into in the format ***.vtu*** and ***.vtp***.</br>
    These variables may need further adjustment if your files are stored on a server - please ask your institutionâ€™s IT service for assistance.
- **Line 16 & 18:** are used to call the svpost command with the settings previously specified.
    - ***NOTE 1 -*** Generating a single file for all timesteps may require a lot of RAM. </br>
    If you are having trouble/experiencing crashes, please check your usage.
    - ***NOTE 2 -*** You are able to change the name of ``all_results`` to whatever you wish. </br>
    However, if you wish to use svPost-flows in the next step it is advised to keep these identical between ***.vtp*** and ***.vtu*** files.
- You can now either: [run the script locally](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2177932/how-do-i-execute-a-bash-script-in-terminal) or submit it to your server.

## svPost-flows.sh - [Example Script](https://github.com/CJBright/BASH/blob/master/svPost/svPost-flows.sh)
#### svPost-flows.sh generates the flow and pressure files created when running svPost from within SimVascular's GUI. </br>svPost-flows.sh uses the ***.vtu*** and ***.vtp*** produced from svPost. Please run that first if you have not already done so. </br> Similarly, the script *WILL* require editing to be applied to your simulation. Guidance is given below.

- ***PRE-REQUISIT:*** This script requires the ``create-flow-files`` binary to be built or installed as outlined [here](https://github.com/ktbolt/cardiovascular/tree/master/create-flow-files).
- **Line 3:** Points the ``generate-flows`` variable to the ``create-flow-files`` binary installed in the **PRE-REQUISIT** step.
- **Lines 6-8:** Sets the input and output directory variables for the flow calculator. </br>
    - ``meshDir`` corresponds to the directory of the mesh surface files (.vtp files) for the simulation. </br>
    - ``resDir`` corresponds to the directory containing the converted simulation results from the previous svPost step. </br>
    - ``outputDir`` corresponds to the directory you wish the pressure and flow files to be written to.
- **Lines 11-13:** Set the flags for the flow calculator. They should match your needs and simulation parameters. </br>
    - ``singleFile`` should be set to ***yes*** if svPost converted the files into a single ***.vtp*** and ***.vtu*** file. It should be set to ***no*** if otherwise. </br>
    - ``skipWalls`` should be set to ***yes*** if you wish to skip the binary calculating average flows and pressures for the wall surfaces. It should be set to ***no*** otherwise. </br>
    - ``units`` should be set to the unit system of your simulation ***cm*** or ***mm***.
